2. [begin_vowels.R](https://github.com/STAT545-UBC-students/hw09-Kate96/blob/master/begin_vowels.R) and its output [vowels_word_count.csv](https://github.com/STAT545-UBC-students/hw09-Kate96/blob/master/vowels_word_count.csv)
3. [begin_vowels_plot.R](https://github.com/STAT545-UBC-students/hw09-Kate96/blob/master/begin_vowels_plot.R) and its output [vowels_word_count.png](https://github.com/STAT545-UBC-students/hw09-Kate96/blob/master/vowels_word_count.png)
4. [report_vowels.md](https://github.com/STAT545-UBC-students/hw09-Kate96/blob/master/report_vowels.md), [report_vowels.Rmd](https://github.com/STAT545-UBC-students/hw09-Kate96/blob/master/report_vowels.Rmd) and the final output [report_vowels.html](https://github.com/STAT545-UBC-students/hw09-Kate96/blob/master/report_vowels.html)

##### More details on the analysis that I did:
I determined which vowel is most likely to appear as a first letter in the word. To do that, I made a `.csv` file which shows the total number of words in the text file which begin with a specified vowel (a, o, u, e, or i). The table was then used to make a barplot, further inserted in the html report. 

I also made two branches of the analysis in the Makefile - one which outputs the report showing the words lengths (original analysis), and the other which outputs the vowels analysis (my analysis).
