#### This repo contains new modifications:
1. 

##### More details on the analysis that I did:
I determined which vowel is most likely to appear as a first letter in the word. To do that, I made a `.csv` file which shows the total number of words in the text file which begin with a specified vowel (a, o, u, e, or i). The table was then used to make a barplot, further inserted in the html report. 

I also made two branches of the analysis in the Makefile - one which outputs the report showing the words lengths, and the other which outputs the vowels analysis.
